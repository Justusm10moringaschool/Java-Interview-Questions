# Java Technical Interview Questions
## Java
* What is the JVM?
    - Java virtual machine is a java runtime environment with specifications designed that dictate syntax for the code being run and the virtual machine running the code.
* Define code compilation?
    - The process of interpreting java source code into bytecode for use by the JVM - which converts the bytcode to native machine language
* What is a constuctor?
    - A method within a class in which creates an object that is an instance of that class when invoked by defining the attributes of the object.
* What is the naming convention of variables in java?
    - Variable names in java should be short(but not single lettered unless the variable is temporary), meaningful and should not start with an underscore or dollar sign.
* What is an annotation and give an example.
    - Annotations are modifiers that add information to code elements. An example is the `@Override` annotation which check for a method in a class in the parent classes.
* What is the difference betwee '==' and equals() when comparing Strings?
    - '==' is an operator that points to the memory location of objects being compared while equals is a method that compares the values of the objects undergoing comparison
* What are the 8 primitive types in Java?
    - boolean , byte , char , short , int , long , float and double.
* What is the difference between primitives and wrapper classes and when can we use each?
    - primitives are the most basic data types in java and they contain the reference value, that is, we can't have and empty primitive whereas wrappers are objects to which these primitives belong.
* Define Encapsulation and outline its benefits.
    - The process of bundling or wrapping methods and variables into one unit which helps in hiding and controlling the implementation details from users
* Do objects get passed by reference or value in Java? Elaborate on that.
    - Java passes object references to methods by value.
* Explain the four OOP principles.
    - Abstraction - the process of using objects variables and methods to represent complex code which helps avoid repetition and improve efficiency.
    - Polymorphism - works by referring to an object in the parent class to affect an object in the child class like implementing functions with the same name but different functionality.
    - Encapsulation - the process of keeping fields within a class private while providing public methods to access them. Enabling the reuse and safeguarding of backend implementation code.
    - Inheritance - A feature that enables programmers to create new classes that share the attributes of another class. It helps us build on previous work without re-inventing the wheel 
* What is the difference between Abstract classes and Interfaces?
* Is it possible to implement multiple inheritance in Java?
* What is serialization? How do you implement it?
* What are anonymous classes?
* What does it means to say that a String is immutable?
* What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
* What are the access modifiers you know? What does each one do?
* Do objects get passed by reference or value in Java? Elaborate on that.
* What the difference between local, instance and class variables?
* What is Dependency Injection?
* What does the static word mean in Java? Can a static method be overridden in Java?
* When is a static block run?
* What is reflection?
* How does the try{} catch{} finally{}
* What is garbage collection? How does it work?
* What is memory leak and how does Java handle it?
* What does the keyword synchronized mean?
* Explain Generics in Java


## Web Development
* What is the difference between a GET and POST request?
* What is a URI?
* Differenciate between a client and host.
* What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
* Point out these components(query, host, port, protocol, path ) in the following URL https://127.0.0.1:4200/login/a=bx?c
* What is an Internet Protocol?
## Android
* What are the four main components of an Android Application?
* What is the purpose of a package name?
* What is the purpose of Android Virtual Device?
